Configuration File’s Structure
配置文件结构
nginx consists of modules which are controlled by directives specified in the configuration file. Directives are divided into simple directives and block directives. A simple directive consists of the name and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;). A block directive has the same structure as a simple directive, but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional instructions surrounded by braces ({ and }). If a block directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a context (examples: events, http, server, and location).
nginx 由那些在配置文件被指令控制的模块组成。指令分为简单指令和块指令。一个简单指令由名称和参数（被空格分开和分号结尾）的组成（大概类似这种 
    listen 8080;
    root /data/up1;
    ）。一个块指令有和简单指令同样的结构，但代替分号的是它以一套附加的指令被({和})结尾。(好难受，大概就是块指令由大括号或花括号包围着像是 
server {
    listen 8080;
    root /data/up1;

    location / {
    }
})。如果一个块指令包含其它指令在大括号内部，它也被叫做上下文（如： events, http, server, and location）。

Directives placed in the configuration file outside of any contexts are considered to be in the main context. The events and http directives reside in the main context, server in http, and location in server.

The rest of a line after the # sign is considered a comment.
