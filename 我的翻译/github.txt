A better way to work together
GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way.

Write better code
Collaboration makes perfect. The conversations and code reviews that happen in Pull Requests help your team share the weight of your work and improve the software you build. Learn about code review.
 
Manage your chaos
Take a deep breath. On GitHub, project management happens in Issues and Projects, right alongside your code. All you have to do is mention a teammate to get them involved. Learn about project management.
 
Find the right tools
Browse and buy apps from GitHub Marketplace with your GitHub account. Find the tools you like or discover new favorites―then start using them in minutes. Learn about integrations.
Security and administration
Boxes? Check.
We worried about your administrative and security needs so you don’t have to. From flexible hosting to authentication options, GitHub can help you meet your team’s requirements.

Code security
Prevent problems before they happen. Protected branches, signed commits, and required status checks protect your work and help you maintain a high standard for your code.

Access controlled
Encourage teams to work together while limiting access to those who need it with granular permissions and authentication through SAML/SSO and LDAP.

Hosted where you need it
Securely and reliably host your work on GitHub.com. Or, deploy GitHub Enterprise on your own servers or in a private cloud using Amazon Web Services, Azure or Google Cloud Platform.
