Lesson: Concurrency
课程：并发
Computer users take it for granted that their systems can do more than one thing at a time. They assume that they can continue to work in a word processor, while other applications download files, manage the print queue, and stream audio. Even a single application is often expected to do more than one thing at a time. For example, that streaming audio application must simultaneously read the digital audio off the network, decompress it, manage playback, and update its display. Even the word processor should always be ready to respond to keyboard and mouse events, no matter how busy it is reformatting text or updating the display. Software that can do such things is known as concurrent software.
计算机用户通过并发赋予他们的系统在同一时间做不止一件事情。计算机用户设想他们可以继续文在处理，，当其它应用在下载文件，处理打印队列，听音乐。就算一个应用程序经常也被期望在同一时间做更多的事情。如播放音乐的时候同事读取必须同事离线读取数字声音信号，解压它，管理重放，更新列表。及时文字处理器也经常准备相应键盘和鼠标事件，无论重新格式化文本或者更新列表多忙。可以做这些事情的软件叫做并发软件。
The Java platform is designed from the ground up to support concurrent programming, with basic concurrency support in the Java programming language and the Java class libraries. Since version 5.0, the Java platform has also included high-level concurrency APIs. This lesson introduces the platform's basic concurrency support and summarizes some of the high-level APIs in the java.util.concurrent packages.
